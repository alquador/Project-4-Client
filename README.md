## User Story
A user will have the ability to signup/login and create a profile(s) to start interacting with other playdate friends! Once a user has created a profile, the user can view an index of playdate friend's profile page.  The profile page describes a specific friend and has the ability to invite said friend for a playdate.  A handy schedule page will display the playdates that a user has accepted and the playdates they are hosting! If a user is unable to attend the playdate, they can delete the scheduled playdate.
